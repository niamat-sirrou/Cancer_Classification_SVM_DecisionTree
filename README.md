# Breast Cancer Classification: Comparative Analysis of SVM and Decision Tree Algorithms

## Project Description
This project aims to perform a comparative analysis between two popular classification algorithms: **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** and **Decision Tree**. The goal is to classify breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on features extracted from digital images.  
The main steps include data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and result interpretation.
